This program is designed to automate the process of logging in to a website and opening multiple pages. It reads configuration data from a JSON file and prompts the user to input new values for specific configuration elements. The user can choose which configurations to run by entering a comma-separated list of numbers between 1 and 5. The program uses the Selenium library to create a webdriver, navigate to the login page, fill in the login form, and open the pages specified in the configuration. If an error occurs during the process, the program prints an error message and exits. The user can also choose to view the current configuration data by running the "show_config" function.
